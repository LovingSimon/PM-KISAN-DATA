# PM-KISAN-DATA
Scraping PM-KISAN beneficiary data (random sample)
This code provides a way to scrape the PM-KISAN data and get district-level representative data from the large, 100 million+ userbase. The code is slower than I would like, but suggestions welcome.
The file named frame_final.xlsx contains district-level number of PM-KISAN beneficiaries (who have received all payments) data so that the random sample can be created using sampling frame. The final sample will contain 100,000 beneficiaries.
The data is only representative of farmers who have received all payments. Any farmer with held-back payment is not considered.
